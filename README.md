# Your Daily Schedule

Your Daily Schedule is an event planner that allows users to stay in tune with their day by notifying users of upcoming events and showing users what events have passed.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Usage

This application allows users to store and reuse their daily events by clicking on the save icon. To use this, type in the event that you want to schedule and save. Once the event passes, the application with update and show that the event has passed. Future events will also be labeled to show which events are up and coming.
